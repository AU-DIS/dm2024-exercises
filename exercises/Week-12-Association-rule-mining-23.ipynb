    "We have learned how to mine frequent itemsets and association rules from a transaction database where each transaction consists of a simple set of items. You are asked to propose a framework for mining association rules from transaction data, in which each item in a transaction is associated with an integer number that counts how many times the items appears in the transaction. In a market basket, this count number indicates the number of copies of a product in a customerâ€™s basket. For example, we do not only care whether a customer bought fish or not, but how many pieces of fish they bought.\n",
